# Raspberry Pi 5: headless playback

Use a 64-bit Linux distribution and a USB audio interface with ALSA support.
The user installs build tools and PortAudio (agents never run sudo):

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build python3 libportaudio2 libasound2-plugins
python3 tools/dev.py build --headless
python3 tools/dev.py test
```

The engine, Qt-free document loader and CLI build without Qt. FetchContent downloads
nlohmann/json at its pinned commit; Internet access is required on first configure.
QtCore document editing tests are optional. The Pi UI remains a stretch; the
headless runner is the supported checkpoint path.

First verify an offline patch. Without `--confirm-audio`, `play` renders ten seconds
to `build/play-offline.wav` and prints peak/RMS and block timing statistics:

```sh
build/native/wirescape_cli play native/examples/Six_Essentials_Demo.json
```

Only the user runs these real-device commands:

```sh
build/native/wirescape_cli play --list-devices
build/native/wirescape_cli play native/examples/Six_Essentials_Demo.json --confirm-audio --device 2 --rate 48000 --block 128
```

Replace `2` with the USB interface's index or exact saved device name. PortAudio
loads `libportaudio.so.2`; ALSA plugins may route to PipeWire/PulseAudio. The runner
uses stereo float output, applies gain/clamp once at the device boundary and prints
`cpu=<percent> xruns=<count> faults=<count>` once per second. Increasing xruns means
the device missed output deadlines; try block 256 and close competing applications.
Ctrl+C stops services, then render, then destroys the engine. MIDI and OSC option
names are reserved for J4/J5; they currently fail with a clear message.

For a device-free ten-minute loader soak (115 MB stereo WAV, no audio backend):

```sh
build/native/wirescape_cli play native/examples/Six_Essentials_Demo.json --seconds 600 --pace --rate 48000 --block 128 --output build/loader-soak.wav
```

Troubleshooting:

- **Device busy:** close other audio applications or select its PipeWire/Pulse ALSA route.
- **Wrong rate:** start at 48000 Hz; inspect the interface's supported rates and choose explicitly.
- **Permissions:** check `/dev/snd` permissions and the distribution's session/audio group policy; log in again after user-managed group changes.
- **Library missing:** install `libportaudio2`; `libasound2-plugins` supplies common server routes.
- **Silent patch:** inspect the offline peak/RMS, output bus and gate wiring before opening a device.
- **Patch refused:** only native v1/v2 patches load. Unknown modules/state/config are reported; originals are never rewritten by `play`.
