DSP is in dsp.h, wrapper registration in module.cpp. No Qt/OS/allocating containers or allocation in processing. Fixed16-channel state is prepared once. SDK owns validation; engine owns base smoothing/normalized modulation/taper. Double phase/IIR state is retained where documented for precision/reference matching. No fast tan approximation is used. Voice groups are four-wide; VCA uses SDK SIMD, while transcendental/IIR scalar math is retained pending measured equivalent SIMD implementations.

Original Wirescape code, GPL-3.0-only, no upstream source.
